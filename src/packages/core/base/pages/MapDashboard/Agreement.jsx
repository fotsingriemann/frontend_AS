        websites. Cookies are then sent back to originating website on each
        subsequent visit. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to
        recognise a user’s device. They are used for a wide variety of purposes
        such as website analytics – counting visitors and their behaviour,
        targeted advertising, recording user preferences or for authentication.

        website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data
        each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the

        The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies
        through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet
